- 👋 Hi, I’m @nirmanlongjam
- 👀 I’m currently interested in computer vision. My long term interest lies in natural language processing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Pytorch and brushing up my math foundations for machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Text Retrieval from imaged documents.
- 📫 How to reach me ... ^_^ soon !

Being a perfectionist, i do digress a lot and usually get myself lost among several books. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a> wastes much valuable time.

Here are few interesting reads i found: (imagine the no. of hours spent finding those ^_^)

<b>Main textbook on Computer Vision:</b> <a href="https://szeliski.org/Book/">Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications, 2nd ed.</a>

<b>Tools:</b> Python, Pytorch and OpenCV

<b>References:</b>
<b>Deep Learning textbook:</b> <a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/">Deep Learning, Goodfellow et. al.</a>
<b>Math foundations</b>
